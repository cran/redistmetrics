Description: Reliable and flexible tools for scoring redistricting plans using 
  common measures and metrics. These functions provide key direct access to 
  tools useful for non-simulation analyses of redistricting plans, such as for 
  measuring compactness or partisan fairness. Tools are designed to work with 
  the 'redist' package seamlessly.
